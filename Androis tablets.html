                <p>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other
                    open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and
                    tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and
                    commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial
                    Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.<br><br>

                    Android includes operating system, middleware and key applications. Other vendors sell customized
                    Android tablets, such as Kindle Fire and Nook, which are used to consume mobile content and provide
                    their own app store, rather than using the larger Google Play system, thereby fragmenting the
                    Android market. In 2022 Google began to re-emphasize in-house Android tablet development — at
                    this point, a multi-year commitment.

                    Fire OS
                    As mentioned above, Amazon Fire OS is an Android-based mobile operating system produced by Amazon
                    for its Fire range of tablets. It is forked from Android. Fire OS primarily centers on content
                    consumption, with a customized user interface and heavy ties to content available from Amazon's own
                    storefronts and services.

                    ChromeOS
                    Several devices that run ChromeOS came on the market in 2017–2019, as tablets, or as 2-in-1s with
                    touchscreen and 360-degree hinge
