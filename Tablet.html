        <p>A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile operating system
            and touchscreen display processing circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a single, thin and flat package.
            Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output (I/O) abilities
            that others have.</p>

        <p> The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen (stylus), instead of the
            mouse, touchpad, and keyboard of larger computers. Portable computers can be classified according to the
            presence and appearance of physical keyboards. Two species of tablet, the slate and booklet, do not have
            physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their
            touchscreen displays. To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard, most tablets can connect to
            independent physical keyboards by Bluetooth or USB; 2-in-1 PCs have keyboards, distinct from tablets.</p>

        <P>The tablet computer and its associated operating system began with the development of pen computing.
            Electrical devices with data input and output on a flat information display existed as early as 1888 with
            the telautograph, which used a sheet of paper as display and a pen attached to electromechanical actuators.
            Throughout the 20th century devices with these characteristics have been imagined and created whether as
            blueprints, prototypes, or commercial products. In addition to many academic and research systems, several
            companies released commercial products in the 1980s, with various input/output types tried out.</P>

        <p>Desktop OS-based tablets are currently thicker and heavier. They require more storage and more cooling and
            give less battery life. They can run processor-intensive graphical applications in addition to mobile apps,
            and have more ports.

            Mobile-based tablets are the reverse, and run only mobile apps. They can use battery life conservatively
            because the processor is significantly smaller. This allows the battery to last much longer than the common
            laptop.

            In Q1 2018, Android tablets had 62% of the market, Apple's iOS had 23.4% of the market and Windows 10 had
            14.6% of the market. In late 2021, iOS has 55% use worldwide (varies by continent, e.g. below 50% in South
            America and Africa) and Android 45% use. Still, Android tablets have more use than iOS in virtually all
            countries, except for e.g. the US and China.</p>
