        <div class="info"><p>Ryzen (/ˈraɪzən/ RY-zən) is a brand of multi-core x86-64 microprocessors designed and marketed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for desktop, mobile, server, and embedded platforms based on the Zen microarchitecture. It consists of central processing units (CPUs) marketed for mainstream, enthusiast, server, and workstation segments and accelerated processing units (APUs) marketed for mainstream and entry-level segments and embedded systems applications.</p>

          <p>  AMD announced a new series of processors on December 13, 2016, named "Ryzen", and delivered them in Q1 2017, the first of several generations. The 1000 series featured up to eight cores and 16 threads, with a 52% instructions per cycle (IPC) increase over their prior CPU products. The second generation of Ryzen processors, the Ryzen 2000 series, released in April 2018, featured the Zen+ microarchitecture, a 12 nm process (GlobalFoundries); the aggregate performance increased 10% (of which approximately 3% was IPC, 6% was frequency); most importantly, Zen+ fixed the cache and memory latencies that had been major weak points (for latency-sensitive workloads, IPC gains of nearly ≈10%). The third generation of Ryzen processors launched on July 7, 2019 and based on AMD's Zen 2 architecture, features more significant design improvements with a 15% average IPC boost, a doubling of floating point capability to a full 256 bit wide execution datapath much like Intel's Haswell microarchitecture released in 2014[14] as well as a shift to an MCM style "chiplet" based package design, and a further shrink to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) 7 nm fabrication process. On June 16, 2020, AMD announced new Ryzen 3000 series XT processors with 100 MHz higher boost clocks versus non XT processors. On October 8, 2020, AMD announced the Zen 3 architecture for their Ryzen 5000 series processors, featuring a 19% instructions per cycle (IPC) improvement over Zen 2, while being built on the same 7 nm TSMC node with out-of-the-box operating boost frequencies exceeding 5 GHz for the first time since AMD's Piledriver. With the launch of Zen 3 via the Ryzen 5000 series, AMD took the lead in gaming performance over Intel, particularly with single-threaded performance. This was followed by an unusually short stop-gap release of Ryzen 6000 mobile-only series processors on January 4th 2022, using the modestly changed Zen3+ core on a 6nm process by TSMC whose claimed up to 15% performance uplift (typical 10% performance) gains were stated to be from frequency rather than IPC. Following this is the Ryzen 7000 series also in 2022 albeit on September 27th, for desktops featuring the new Zen4 core with a 13% uplift in IPC and 15% increase in frequency for a claimed nearly 30% in (single thread) performance. It is worth noting that Ryzen 7000 features a brand new AM5 socket only supports DDR5 memories unlike AMD's previous DDR3 sockets like AM2/+ and AM3/+ offering DDR2 and DDR3 options and Intels Alder Lake platforms that offer DDR4/DDR5 compatibility.</p>
            
            <P>A majority of AMD's consumer Ryzen products use the Socket AM4 platform. In August 2017, AMD launched their Ryzen Threadripper line aimed at the enthusiast workstation market. AMD Ryzen Threadripper uses the larger TR4, sTRX4, and sWRX8 sockets, which support additional memory channels and PCI Express lanes. AMD plans to move to the new Socket AM5 platform for consumer desktop Ryzen with the release of Zen 4 products in late 2022.</P>
            
            <p>In December 2019, AMD started producing first generation Ryzen products built using the second generation Zen+ architecture. The most notable example is Ryzen 5 1600, with newest batches, having "AF" identifier instead of its usual "AE", being essentially an underbinned Ryzen 5 2600 with the same specifications as the original Ryzen 5 1600.</p></div>
